# Chicken and Potato Soup

## Ingredients
- 1 medium yellow onion
- 2 medium carrots
- 2 medium stalks celery
- 3 cloves garlic
- 1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs (3 medium or 2 large breasts, or 5 to 6 thighs)
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided, plus more as needed
- 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more as needed
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 3/4 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 1/2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes (3 medium or 6 small)
- 1/3 cup all-purpose flour
- 4 cups low-sodium chicken broth

## Instructions
1. Prepare the following vegetables, adding them each to the same medium bowl as you complete it:
  * Dice 1 medium yellow onion (about 1 1/2 cups).
  * Peel and halve 2 medium carrots lengthwise, then cut crosswise into 1/2-inch pieces (about 1 cup).
  * Cut 2 medium celery stalks crosswise into 1/4-inch pieces (about 1 cup).
  * Finely chop 3 garlic cloves.
2. Season 1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs all over with 1 teaspoon of the kosher salt and 1/4 teaspoon of the black pepper.
3. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat until shimmering. Add the onion mixture, 3/4 teaspoon dried thyme, 1 bay leaf, and the remaining 1 teaspoon kosher salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is softened and translucent, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, quarter the Yukon Gold potatoes (about 3 1/2 cups, no need to peel).
4. Add the potatoes to the pot and stir to combine. Sprinkle with 1/3 cup all-purpose flour and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute to cook the floury taste out. While stirring constantly, pour in 1 (32-ounce) box low-sodium chicken broth and 2 cups whole or 2% milk. Add the chicken in a single layer. Increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a lively simmer, stirring occasionally.
5. Reduce the heat as needed to maintain a gentle simmer. Cook, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pot occasionally, until the potatoes are tender, the chicken is cooked through, and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the chicken registers at least 165Â°F, about 10 minutes for thighs or 12 to 18 minutes for breasts.
6. Remove the pot from the heat. Using tongs, transfer the chicken to a clean cutting board and shred into bite-size pieces.
7. Remove and discard the bay leaf. Return the chicken to the soup. Taste and season with more kosher salt and black pepper as needed.

- Make sure the soup isn't boiling when you add the chicken, or it will come out rubbery.
- The kid loved it and actually asked for leftovers.  He especially liked the carrots.  
- The original calls for one box of broth and two cups of milk, but I accidentally used two cartons of chicken stock instead.  I added a couple tablespoons of butter and a splash of half and half to compensate.  Extra flour was needed in order to sufficiently thicken the soup.
