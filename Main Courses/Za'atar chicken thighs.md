# Za'atar Chicken Thighs
## Ingredients
### Chicken
- 6 Chicken thighs
- 4 tbsp Za’atar
- 1½ kg / 3 lb. new potatoes

### Romesco sauce
- 100 g / 3.5 oz. blanched almonds
- 2 roasted red peppers
- 100 g / 3.5 oz. cherry tomatoes
- 1 clove garlic
- 1 tsp chilli flakes
- 1 tsp salt
- ½ tsp smoked paprika
- 25 g Parsley
- 50 ml /3½ tablespoons olive oil

## Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F.
2. Rub the chicken thighs all over with olive oil and plenty of flaky sea salt.
3. Place a heavy pan over a medium heat and cook the chicken thighs skin side down for about 7 or 8 mins until the skin is golden and crispy. Take off the heat and season with 2 tbsp of za’atar.
4. Parboil the potatoes for 7 mins in heavily salted water. Drain and shake hard in the colander to rough up the outer surface.
5. Add 4 tbsp olive oil to a roasting tray and place into the oven. Let it heat up for 5 mins, then add the potatoes and shake well.
6. Place the chicken thighs skin side up on top of the potatoes and season the skin side with the remaining za’atar. Place the tray into the oven for 20 mins.
7. Meanwhile, make the romesco sauce.
8. Toast the blanched almonds for a few minutes in a dry pan over a medium heat. Add to the food processor along with the peppers, tomatoes, garlic, chili flakes, smoked paprika and a tsp of salt. Blend until emulsified, then drizzle in the oil with the processor running.
9. On a large serving platter, spread the romesco evenly, top with the roast potatoes and then the chicken. Sprinkle with chopped parsley and a drizzle of olive oil. Best served with a simple green salad.
