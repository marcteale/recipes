# Kielbasa stew

## Ingredients 

- 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 large red onion, diced
- 4 cloves garlic, smashed
- 1 tablespoon paprika
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 4 cups water
- 18 ounces (1 package) kielbasa, cut into a large dice
- 3 medium carrots, peeled and cut into large chunks
- 2 parsnips, peeled and cut into large chunks
- 14 ounces small red-skinned or new potatoes (6 to 8), quartered
- 1 tablespoon cider vinegar
- Freshly ground pepper
- Greek yogurt/sour cream
- Crusty bread, for serving

## Instructions
1. Starting from a cold Dutch oven, brown the kielbasa.  Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.
2. Add the onion and garlic; cook, stirring occasionally, until soft and glistening, about 6 minutes.  Add 1-2 tablespoons olive oil if mixture is too dry.
3. Add the paprika and 1 teaspoon salt; cook until the oil turns deep red, about 1 minute. 
4. Add the flour and cook until just toasted, 30 more seconds. Immediately whisk in 4 cups water. 
5. Add the kielbasa and any accumulated juices, carrots, parsnips, and potatoes.
6. Bring the soup to a boil, then reduce to a simmer; cover and cook until the vegetables are tender and the broth has thickened, about 20 minutes. 
7. Add vinegar and season with pepper.

Serve with bread and a dollop of Greek yogurt/sour cream on top.
